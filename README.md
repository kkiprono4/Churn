# Churn
# E-commerce-Churn-Prediction
## Overview
Customer churn - also known as customer attrition – is when a customer stops using/buying your products or services.
It’s a measure of the number of customers leaving a business over a specific period of time.
Customer churn is something that every business has to deal with because customers always come and go, but if churn is left unchecked, it can greatly impact your revenue in the long run.
Build a model that determines whether or not a customer churns.
